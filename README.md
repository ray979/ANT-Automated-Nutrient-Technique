# ANT-Automated-Nutrient-Technique
UCI Senior Design Project: ANT. ANT is an attempt at building an automated hydroponic system using Nutrition Film Technique(NTF). NTF technique is chosen over other hydroponic technique in this system, because of low resource consumption (water and nutrient) in this hydroponic method and constant flow of water meaning no still water, thus, less disease/fungi can develop or grow.  This system will include environmental sensors (PH, EC, temperature, â€¦ etc.) in which data from these sensors will subsequently activated certain automation like automated fertilizer dosing under certain conditions (ie. low EC readings). Example of another automation this system would include will be auto ph balancing where ph down or ph up will be dosed when the ph sensor readings are out of the desired range.
