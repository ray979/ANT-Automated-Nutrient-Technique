# ANT-Automated-Nutrition-Technique
UCI Senior Design Project: ANT. ANT is an attempt at building an automated hydroponic system using Nutrition Film Technique(NTF). NTF technique is chosen over other hydroponic technique in this system, because of low resource consumption (water and nutrient) in this hydroponic method and constant flow of water meaning there would be no still water, thus, less disease and fungi can grow.  

This system will include environmental sensors (PH, EC, and temperature) in which data from these sensors will subsequently activate certain automations like automated fertilizer dosing under certain conditions like when low EC readings are detected or the EC reading is below range. Another automation this system would include will be automatic PH balancing where PH down or PH up will be dosed when the ph sensor readings are out of the desired range.
*PH UP solution increases the PH and PH DOWN decreases the PH.*
